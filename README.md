Replication Materials for When All is Said and Done:
Updating ‘Elections, Special Interests, and Financial Crisis’
=====================

*Forthcoming in Research and Politics*

The materials in this repository replicate and explore findings from
[Keefer (2007)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0020818307070208)
using updated data on the fiscal costs of financial crises from
[Laeven and Valencia (2012)](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.aspx?sk=26015.0).

The [analysis/ModelUpdate.do](analysis/ModelUpdate.do) Stata 12.1 estimates
the regression models.

Tables of these results shown in the paper's main text and supplementary
materials can then be created by
[analysis/StataResultsTableMaker.R](analysis/StataResultsTableMaker.R) in R.

Figures in the paper are created with
[analysis/FiguresReplicationV2.R](analysis/FiguresReplicationV2.R).

Replication data can be found in the [data/](data/) subdirectory.
